# iOS Transformation Plan - Overview

## Project Summary

**Project Name:** Quality Control (QC) - Relationship Check-in App
**Current State:** Next.js Web POC
**Target Platform:** iOS Native (Swift/SwiftUI)
**Timeline:** 12 weeks to MVP
**Team Size:** TBD

---

## Executive Summary

Quality Control is a relationship wellness app designed to help couples maintain healthy relationships through structured check-ins, progress tracking, and thoughtful communication tools. The current Next.js proof-of-concept has validated the core UX flows and features. This plan outlines the transformation from web POC to a production-ready native iOS application.

## Why iOS Native?

### Benefits Over Web
1. **Superior Performance** - Smooth 60/120fps animations, instant responsiveness
2. **Native Integration** - Widgets, Live Activities, Shortcuts, Apple Watch
3. **Offline-First** - Full functionality without internet via SwiftData/CloudKit
4. **Platform Features** - Face ID, Haptics, Dynamic Island, Focus modes
5. **App Store Discovery** - Access to 1B+ iOS users
6. **Better UX** - Native navigation patterns, gestures, and conventions

### Market Opportunity
- 50M+ couples in US alone
- Growing wellness app market ($15B by 2027)
- Limited high-quality relationship check-in apps
- Premium pricing potential ($4.99-$9.99/month)

## Core Principles

### 1. Privacy First
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- User controls what's shared with partner
- Three-tier privacy model (Private, Shared, Draft)
- No data sold to third parties

### 2. Delightful UX
- Animations that feel magical, not gimmicky
- Haptic feedback for all key interactions
- Dark mode support from day one
- Accessibility as a first-class feature

### 3. Science-Backed
- Evidence-based communication prompts
- Validated relationship assessment frameworks
- Partnership with relationship researchers (future)

### 4. Build for Scale
- Clean architecture (MVVM + Coordinators)
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Modular design for feature flags
- Backend-ready structure (CloudKit → custom backend)
